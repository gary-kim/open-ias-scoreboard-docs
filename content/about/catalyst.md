### Open IAS Scoreboard was originally developed for Singapore American School's Digital Frontiers club by Gary Kim.

This is my first large scale and major program I started and designed to run locally on a computer offline, so a lot of what I learned including all my experience using the Electron APIs, Yarn, and eslint has come from making this program. In addition, I wanted to try using the Electron API to create a program for a while. That, combined with my philosophy “if it ain’t broke, improve it” made our situation in Digital Frontiers with expensive and buggy scoreboards the perfect problem to tackle with this interest.
