### Open IAS Scoreboard was originally developed for Singapore American School's Digital Frontiers club by Gary Kim.

This is my first large scale and major program I started and designed to run locally on a computer offline, so a lot of what I learned including all my experience using the Electron APIs, Yarn, and ESLint has come from making this program. In addition, I wanted to try using the Electron API to create a program for a while. That, combined with my philosophy “if it ain’t broke, improve it” made our situation in Digital Frontiers with expensive and buggy scoreboards the perfect problem to tackle with this interest.

For Digital Frontiers, this will be a big help in the years to come. It will finally allow us to run our scoreboard software on any computer we choose and tweak it to the needs of the club. In addition to this, the club will no longer be paying around $70 per computer to license the previously used scoreboard software. This will help to save hundreds of dollars a year for the club, enough savings to use to get even better equipment to improve other parts of the livestream such as quality and reliability.
