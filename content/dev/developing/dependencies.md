## Managing Dependencies in Open IAS Scoreboard

The Open IAS Scoreboard project uses [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) to handle dependencies.

### Adding a Dependency


```bash
# Run this command to add a dependency from the project root
npm install --save dependency-to-add
```

---

### Updating All Dependencies

This will usually be done early in each release cycle by the project maintainer. Please make an issue if you need a dependency to be upgraded later in the release cycle.
